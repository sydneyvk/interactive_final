<div id="intro" >
  <p> How do animators breathe life onto a blank canvas? How do they get us to laugh at Pascal, sympathize with Carl, and feel the longing of Ariel wanting to be part of your world? How do they make us believe that the things they’ve rendered are actually alive?</p> <p>To answer any of these questions, one must first understand the 12 principles of animation. Made famous by two of Walt Disney’s legendary Nine Old Men, Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas, the 12 principles of animation have become an essential must-learn for all aspiring and working animators in the industry today. </p>

<div class="group">
<section class="principle" id="squash-and-stretch">
  <div>
   <h4>Squash and Stretch</h4>
   <p>
     Squash and Stretch – The squash and stretch principle gives the illusion of weight and volume to a character as they move. This is done by expanding and compressing the character’s body.
   </p>

  <section class="principle" id="anticipation">
  <div>
    <h4>Anticipation</h4>
    <p>
     Anticipation is used to let the audience know that a major action is about to take place. To do this, animators will often work in a smaller action or two, right before the major action to signal that something is coming.
    </p>

       <figure class="anticipation">
          <img alt="Anticipation" src="img/anticipation_updated.gif">

      </div>
  </section>
</div>

  <div class="group">
  <section class="principle" id="staging">
    <div>
     <h4>Staging</h4>
     <p>
     Staging is the principle that every pose or action that a character makes should convey a clear intention. Solid staging creates a more dynamic and interesting scene.
     </p>

        <figure class="staging">
           <img alt="Staging" src="img/staging_updated.gif">
         </figure>
       </div>

   </section>

   <section class="principle" id="straight-ahead">
     <div>
      <h4>Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose</h4>
      <p>
    Straight ahead and pose to pose refers to the techniques by which animation is crafted. The pose to pose technique involves drawing the key poses that you’d like the character to take first and then filling in the transitional poses second. The straight ahead technique is more nuanced and involves an animator literally crafting one frame after another.
      </p>

         <figure class="straight-ahead">
            <img alt="Straight Ahead" src="img/posetopose_updated.gif">
          </figure>
</div>
      </section>
    </div>




    <div class="group">
    <section class="principle" id="follow-through">
      <div>
       <h4>Follow Through and Overlapping Action</h4>
       <p>
          The follow through principle argues that when a character is in action and stops, nothing stops all at once. So when a character is running and stops, their main body will stop, but the other parts of their body will keep moving for a bit after.
       </p>

          <figure class="follow-through">
             <img alt="Follow Through" src="img/overlapping_action_updated.gif">
           </figure>
         </div>
      </section>


     <section class="principle" id="slow-in-out">
       <div>
        <h4>Slow-In and Slow-Out</h4>
        <p>
         When characters are performing actions, animators will draw more frames at the start of the action, less frames in the middle, and more frames again at the end of the action to create this slow-in/slow-out effect. (Kind of like a pendulum!) Notice how Snow White’s actions in this scene are slow at the beginning and fast in the middle and then slow at the end.
        </p>

               <figure class="slow-in-out">
                  <img alt="Slow-In and Slow-out" src="img/slowinslow_updated.gif">
                </figure>
              </div>
      </section>
    </div>




    <div class="group">
      <section class="principle" id="arc">
        <div>
         <h4>Arc</h4>
         <p>
          The arc principle is that almost all actions in life have a slightly circular motion. When a head turns or an arm moves, rarely will it thrust straight in and straight out. Often it will have a little curve to it.
         </p>

            <figure class="arc">
               <img alt="Arc" src="img/arch_updated.gif">
             </figure>
</div>
       </section>


       <section class="principle" id="secondary-action">
         <div>
          <h4>Secondary Action</h4>
          <p>
        A secondary action is an additional action that reinforces and adds more dimension to the main action. This further sells the movement.</p>

           <figure class="sectondary-action">
              <img alt="Secondary Action" src="img/secondary_action_updated.gif">
            </figure>
</div>
        </section>
      </div>

      <div class="group">
        <section class="principle" id="timing">
          <div>
           <h4>Timing</h4>
           <p>
          Timing helps create the illusion that an action is abiding by the laws of physics. By adjusting the timing of a scene, animators can make that scene look either slower and smoother (with more frames) or faster and crisper (with less frames).</p>

             <figure class="timing">
                <img alt="Timing" src="img/timing_updated.gif">
              </figure>
</div>
         </section>

         <section class="principle" id="exaggeration">
           <div>
            <h4>Exaggeration</h4>
            <p>
           Exaggeration is all about overstating certain movements in a way that helps evoke a point, yet doesn’t ruin the believability of the scene. This often adds another level of personality!</p>

              <figure class="exaggeration">
                 <img alt="Exaggeration" src="img/exaggeration_updated.gif">
               </figure>
</div>
          </section>
        </div>

        <div class="group">

          <section class="principle" id="solid-drawing">
            <div>
             <h4>Solid Drawing</h4>
             <p>
             This principle encourages animators to be mindful of the fact that while forms may be presented in 2D, they should strive to look 3D.</p>

                <figure class="solid-drawing">
                   <img alt="Solid Drawing" src="img/solid_drawing_updated.gif">
                 </figure>
</div>
           </section>

           <section class="principle" id="appeal">
             <div>
              <h4>Appeal</h4>
              <p>
             Obviously, not every character should be appealing. But this principle posits that animators should strive to create images that will be interesting and compelling to audiences.</p>

                <figure class="appeal">
                   <img alt="Appeal" src="img/appeal_updated.gif">
                 </figure>
               </div>
            </section>
          </div>
